# Commentable #

This package enables the creation of models that can be commented on. For example a photo in an photo album could have comments, but also a post to a users feed could as well. Rather than maintaining a photo comments collection and a post comments collection we can implement CommentableModel on our `Post` and `Photo` models and then use it's new methods to store and retrieve comments and information about them, linked to these models.

## Supporting the Project ##
In the spirit of keeping this and all of the packages in the [Socialize](https://atmospherejs.com/socialize) set alive, I ask that if you find this package useful, please donate to it's development.

## Installation ##

This package relies on the npm package `simpl-schema` so you will need to make sure it is installed as well.

```shell
$ meteor npm install --save simpl-schema
$ meteor add socialize:commentable
```

## Basic Usage ##

```javascript
import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';
import { CommentableModel } from 'meteor/socialize-commentable';
import { LinkParent, LinkableModel } from 'meteor/socialize-linkable';
import SimpleSchema from 'simpl-schema';

//define the collection to hold products
const PhotosCollection = new Mongo.Collection("photos");

//define the schema for a product
const PhotosSchema = new SimpleSchema({
    "userId":{
        type:String,
        regEx:SimpleSchema.RegEx.Id,
        autoValue:function () {
            if(this.isInsert){
                return this.userId;
            }
        },
        denyUpdate:true
    },
    "date":{
        type:Date,
        autoValue:function() {
            if(this.isInsert){
                return new Date();
            }
        },
        denyUpdate:true
    }
    //actual schema truncated for brevity
});

//Create a product class extending LikeableModel and LinkParent
class Photo extends CommentableModel(LinkParent) {
    //methods here
}

//Attach the collection to the model so we can use BaseModel's CRUD methods
Photo.attachCollection(PhotosCollection);

Photo.attachSchema(PhotosSchema);
Photo.attachSchema(CommentableModel.CommentableSchema);

//Register the Model as a potential Parent of a LinkableModel
LinkableModel.registerParentModel(Photo);


//Create a new product and save it to the database using BaseModel's save method.
new Photo({caption:"Meteor Camp 2016!", cloudinaryId:"sL0Jbf3gBaoeubs3G822WQqwp"}).save();

//Get an instance of Product using a findOne call.
let foundPhoto = PhotosCollection.findOne();

//subscribe to the comments for this particular photo
Meteor.subscribe('socialize.commmentsFor', foundPhoto._id);

//Post a comment that will be linked to the photo.
foundPhoto.addComment("This was so much fun!");

//Get a cursor of comments for this photo
foundPhoto.comments().forEach((comment) => {
    console.log(`${comment.user().username}: ${comment.body}`);
});
```

## Scalability - Redis Oplog ##

This package contains a preliminary implementation of [cultofcoders:redis-oplog][1]'s namespaces to provide reactive scalability as an alternative to Meteor's `livedata`. Use of redis-oplog is not required and will not engage until you install the [cultofcoders:redis-oplog][1] package and configure it.

Due to the preliminary nature of this implementation, you may run into minor issues. Please report any issues you find to GitHub so that they can be fixed.
